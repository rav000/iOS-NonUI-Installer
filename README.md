# How to use

1. SSH ramdisk using Semaphorin
2. Make placeholder partition `newfs_apfs -A /dev/disk0s1` (only if you are using A7, Wi-Fi only iPads, and iPod touch)
3. Download NonUI dump, rename it to `build.tar` or `build.tar.gz` or `build.tgz`
4. Run `./install.sh` and let it do its own thing
5. For bootchain, do it on your own (gonna add it soonâ„¢)
6. To boot it, add your patched bootchain files into `boot` folder
7. To boot NonUI, use `./boot.sh`

# SSH into the device while SwitchBoard is running

1. Make sure the device booted into SwitchBoard and plugged into your Mac
2. Open terminal windor and run `iproxy 2222 22`
3. Open another terinal window and run `ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -p 2222 root@localhost`
4. If it asks for password, use `alpine` as the password
